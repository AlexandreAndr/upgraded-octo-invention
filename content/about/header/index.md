<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD student in Computer & Information Science at `Penn` specializing in NeuroAI with a focus on sequence modeling. Iâ€™m a member of the `NerDS Lab`, where I have the privilege of being advised by `Prof. Eva Dyer`. My research interests span `neuro foundation models`, `time series transformers`, `state space models`, and their applications, including `brain-computer interface` and `neural decoding`. Prior to this, I obtained a Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and a Master of Engineering in Computer Science at UniversitÃ© de Technologie de CompiÃ¨gne. I also gained industry experience with large-scale datasets and applications as an intern at Deezer.
